# Project Apsu: Phase 0 Review Package (v1)

This package contains the deliverables for the successful completion of **Phase 0: Environment Setup & Baseline Characterization**.

## Summary

The goal of this phase was to establish a stable, reproducible development environment and to validate the fundamental properties of our chosen "classical substrate," the `ClassicalSystem`.

This goal was achieved by:
1.  Creating a version-pinned `requirements.txt` for a stable local Python environment.
2.  Implementing the `ClassicalSystem` class in `classical_system.py`.
3.  Implementing the `diagnose()` method as per the specification to generate a visual report on the health of the internal Echo State Networks.

## Artifacts

*   `diagnostics_report.png`: The primary deliverable. This plot provides a visual fingerprint of the reservoir's dynamics.
*   `classical_system.py`: The exact Python script used to generate the diagnostic report.
*   `requirements.txt`: The list of pinned Python dependencies required to replicate the environment.

## Review Request

Please review the `diagnostics_report.png` to confirm that it meets the **Phase 0 Success Gate**:
> The diagnostic plot must show a "healthy" reservoir. The neuron activation histogram must be broadly distributed within [-1, 1] without significant "piling up" at the boundaries (saturation) or at the center (dead reservoir). The time-series plots must show complex, aperiodic behavior. The PCA plot must show a high-dimensional, tangled attractor.

If the plot is satisfactory, Phase 0 can be considered successfully closed.
